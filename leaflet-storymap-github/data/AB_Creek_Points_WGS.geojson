According to Bill Lewis, an elderly East York storyteller, this stream actually began further to the northwest in a wetland behind the houses on the east side of Hassard Ave., near Pape and O’Connor. He told of oak groves all around William Burgess public school near Woodville and Pape, and of tobogganing down a hill above the creek’s banks. It is surprising but true that much of Old East York drained, not to the Don River, but south to Ashbridge’s Bay. Ashbridge’s Creek is the longest of the lost streams in Ashbridge’s Bay drainage catchment (watershed).

Further littoral (shoreline) silt deposits at the end of this bar evidently created a series of “dune” features in this neighbourhood that now appear as high, sandy hillocks Formation possibly from prehistoric Lake Iroquois.
