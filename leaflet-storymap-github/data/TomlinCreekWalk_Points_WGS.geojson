About 13,000 years ago, as the last glaciation was retreating, this much larger precursor filled the Lake Ontario basin to a much higher level. Littoral (shoreline) erosion and drift from Scarborough Bluffs formed the bar stretching from near Kington Rd. and Danforth Ave. (Variety Village building), through the heights here of East Toronto, to the high ground of East York, where East York Community Centre stands.
